## 📖 About
BogoSort Game is an educational tool designed to visualize the concept of **algorithmic inefficiency** through satire. Instead of traditional sorting visualizations, this project uses a **Slot Machine metaphor** to demonstrate the mechanics of the BogoSort algorithm (Permutation Sort), which has a time complexity of $O(n \cdot n!)$.

The application features a custom 8-bit Pixel Art aesthetic and a robust Finite State Machine (FSM) architecture.

## 🚀 Features
- **Gamified Logic:** Users act as the "Algorithm Operator," experiencing the frustration of inefficient sorting firsthand.
- **Visual Feedback:** 8-bit aesthetic with retro sound effects and animations.
- **Dynamic Difficulty:**
  - **Easy:** 3 numbers ($3! = 6$ combinations)
  - **Hard:** 7 numbers ($7! = 5,040$ combinations - purely luck-based)
- **Architecture:** Built using a Finite State Machine pattern (Menu -> Tutorial -> Game -> Victory) to manage application flow efficiently.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.12
- **Library:** Pygame (SDL wrapper) for rendering and sprite management.
- **Concepts:**
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - Asset Management (Relative paths for cross-platform compatibility)
  - Event-Driven Programming
